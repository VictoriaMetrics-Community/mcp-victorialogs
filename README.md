# VictoriaLogs MCP Server

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@VictoriaMetrics-Community/mcp-victorialogs)](https://smithery.ai/server/@VictoriaMetrics-Community/mcp-victorialogs)

The implementation of [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for [VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/).

This provides access to your VictoriaLogs instance and seamless integration with [VictoriaLogs APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api) and [documentation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/).
It can give you a comprehensive interface for logs, observability, and debugging tasks related to your VictoriaLogs instances, enable advanced automation and interaction capabilities for engineers and tools.

## Features

This MCP server allows you to use almost all read-only APIs of VictoriaLogs, i.e. all functions available in [Web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui):

- Querying logs and exploring logs data
- Showing parameters of your VictoriaLogs instance
- Listing available streams, fields, field values
- Query statistics for the logs as metrics
 
In addition, the MCP server contains embedded up-to-date documentation and is able to search it without online access.

More details about the exact available tools and prompts can be found in the [Usage](#usage) section.

You can combine functionality of tools, docs search in your prompts and invent great usage scenarios for your VictoriaLogs instance.
And please note the fact that the quality of the MCP Server and its responses depends very much on the capabilities of your client and the quality of the model you are using.

You can also combine the MCP server with other observability or doc search related MCP Servers and get even more powerful results.

## Requirements

## Disclaimer

AI services and agents along with MCP servers like this cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness and reliability of results.
You should double check the results obtained with AI.
The quality of the MCP Server and its responses depends very much on the capabilities of your client and the quality of the model you are using.
